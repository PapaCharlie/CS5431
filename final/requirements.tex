\section{System Purpose}
\label{sec:system_purpose}

Signing into services is one of the most common security features for keeping the confidentiality of the user on the Internet. However, for security purposes, passwords ought to be both hard to discover and used only once for each service. In order to increase user psychological acceptability, this system provides a ''vault'' for the users to both generate more complex passwords and to confidently store all passwords in a secure manner, both of which may be accessed from anywhere and any device.

\section{Threat Analysis}
\label{sec:threat_analysis}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Disgruntled employees (Internal Threat) - This kind of threat is motivated by personal vendettas against the company (or in this case the system since there is no company). The employee is likely to want to see this system fail and will have access to either the source code or the server. They will have moderate to high skill level, as well as the number of resources.
  \item Personal enemies (External Threat) - This kind of threat is motivated by personal vendettas. They seek to obtain or modify the passwords of people they know. By doing so, they can get all kinds of information on their enemies, limited only by what kinds of passwords are stored in the vault (e.g. bank account password, email password, etc). They will have low to moderate skill level and a limited number of resources.
  \item Organized crime group (External Threat) - This kind of threat is often motivated by personal gain. They seek to obtain the passwords of all users of this system. With those passwords, they can access all online accounts that are stored in the manager. This could cause damage in all levels of the harm spectrum, ranging from stealing someoneâ€™s money to sending a bad email. They will have high skill level and moderate number of resources.
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Requirements}
\label{sec:security_requirements}

\subsection{Security Goals}
\label{sub:security_goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system shall not reveal the master password of any account to unauthorized users. (Confidentiality)
  \item The system shall not reveal any stored passwords to unauthorized users. (Confidentiality)
  \item The system shall prevent unauthorized users from modifying the master password that would lead to locking out the authorized user from his own vault. (Availability)
  \item The system shall prevent unauthorized users from modifying any of the stored passwords in a vault. (Integrity)
  \item The system shall only allow the owner of the vault/account to modify any of the settings. (Integrity)
  \item The system shall only allow authorized users to view the vault event log. (Confidentiality)
  \item The system shall not allow any user to modify the vault event log. (Integrity)
  \item The system shall prevent unauthorized users from viewing the secure notes. (Confidentiality)
  \item The system shall prevent unauthorized users from modifying the secure notes. (Integrity).
  \item The system shall prevent unauthorized users from viewing a user's phone number. (Integrity)
\end{itemize}

\section{Essential Security Elements}
\label{sec:essential_security_elements}

\begin{description}
  \item[Authorization] All users must be authorized to perform certain actions. Users have access to things such as event logs and accounts settings like number of current sessions and session time; they can also access, modify, delete, and share stored passwords, as well as use the password generator. The system implements the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Policy. There is a reference monitor through which all users must pass through in order to receive a token. Having an verified token grants the user all rights associated with using all components of his own vault. The rights are implied by the token. Since the user himself cannot assign rights to other subjects and instead tokens and therefore rights are handed out by the server, this is a MAC authorization policy.
  \item[Authentication] All users are authenticated by logging into their vault with their username and master password. Also, they are required to enter a secondary authentication code received via text message on their phone as part of 2-Factor Authentication. These 2 steps are necessary checkpoints that all users must pass in order to reach their vault. Once the user is authenticated by the server, he receives a verified token that he uses to stay authenticated as he traverses through the different components of his vault.
  \item[Audit] All user activities such as logins, password modifications, and settings changes, will be logged so that users can view everything that occurs in their vault. This will help users catch unauthorized access to their vault by malicious principals.
  \item[Confidentiality] This system must provide confidentiality to user information and passwords because the nature of the system is to store sensitive passwords that should only be accessed by those to whom the passwords belong. This password manager will address confidentiality in the following ways: \begin{itemize}
    \item All passwords being stored are kept confidential.
    \item Account settings can only be made known to the user himself.
    \item Event logs can only be read by the user.
    \item All user information, such as phone number, cannot be revealed.
    \item The algorithm for generating passwords is kept secret.
    \item The master password is not known to the password manager; only the user knows it.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Integrity] This system must provide integrity to the stored user passwords, user settings, master encryption, and account information. The password manager will address will address integrity in the following ways:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All passwords being stored cannot be modified except by authorized and authenticated users.
      \item Account settings cannot be changed except by authorized and authenticated users.
      \item Event logs cannot be modified by anyone.
      \item The master password and account information cannot be changed except by authorized and authenticated users.
      \item The encryption to get into the vault cannot be modified.
    \end{itemize}
